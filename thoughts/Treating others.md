Another core belief I have is that it only makes sense to treat others as if they have the same intellectual capacity as you, unless stated otherwise. I try to always give someone the benefit of the doubt, because often times, even if it may seem they aren't as sharp in a given moment, it's probably an articulation problem. When faced with others, people are governed by their ability to transmit information through speech and body language. 

This poses serious challenges to everyone involved. Whoever is talking has to transform thoughts as they rush in through their mind into words, and words into sentences, sentences (hopefully) into ideas both compelling and articulate. The receiving party then has to catch what is being said
while simultaneously listening to their own thoughts, possibly shutting them up so they may continue to listen and try to understand what was inside someone else's head. I do think it's a miracle that we can communicate with each other, and I do not think we are the only species able to do it.

I know I've found myself often rethinking conversations, sometimes in glorious reverie, sometimes in frustration with how I worded something close to my heart, now having an articulate method or sharing the thought. Everyone does this, everyone wishes, at times, they could've said something different, made a better connection with another. 

That's why I make it a *serious point* to make others feel comfortable around me when I talk to them. 

It means looking at their face, and their body to see if they appear stressed or not, and offering anything that could help if they are. 

That means asking questions, not assuming.  

It means listening and considering, not blurting out or interrupting. 

It's one thing to *appear* to follow these points. It's a super power to embody them. To believe them. Those who I admire most have these abilities, and so I too try to live up to these ideals. 

They exist outside of conversing with people too. I think it's the right way to approach learning anything in life, and what is life without curiosity, and therefore, learning? These are simply products of being mindful, or careful with your thoughts. If I have a serious conviction or a belief system, these points are at the top.
