It is done. I am married. I want to bottle up the primal feeling my finger feels as it senses the slight weight of the ring. It shifts along throughout the day as I move. My eyes caught starring as it's polished gold glimmers. Precious indeed. I realize it's the first time I've bought myself jewelry. 

The novelty will fade as will my memories, so here's to making them last a little longer lest I forget how much joy was brought to me on that day in November.

The weeks leading up to the wedding felt like a raging river of expectations, stirring my insides, even though the wedding was as small as we could manage—with just one parent each and two friends: an officiant and a photographer. It was such a nice day. The gods truly shone on us both, the light radiant, and the air crisp after a heavy rain. As the clouds parted, we shared some small words of love, mere drops of what we've experienced together over the past 6 years. Potent drops nonetheless. 

Now, I've washed ashore and feel the slightest weight of a commitment made real, turned into gold. It's peaceful. Like basking in sunlight. My feelings are no different than before. My partner is my wife, and feeling the ring on my finger reminds me that this dream comes true every day.

I know that feeling will fade, at least the freshness of the wedding will. I can't help but imagine distant futures where I find my fingers worn by the passage of time, drooping and angled. No doubt, I will still appreciate the meaning the ring is imbued with. Hopefully, the feeling will evolve with time, aging into something finer and finer with every passing year. As long as we stay playful and silly together, we'll age gracefully; to that, I am faithful.

Over the years, we've framed a space of peace and comfort around each other—one where we can take the time to talk. Sometimes not enough and sometimes far too much. But there is never too much talking with the person you choose to spend your life with.

Love is self-defined, both self-love and love between people. It is meant to be shared with others on their own terms after trust has been built. Our definitions of love evolve as we live. Hence, we must work to understand love by asking questions and learning what it means to each of us.

It takes time to define love within yourself. If you are lucky, you're shown lasting love early and unconditionally. If you're unlucky, you may never feel worthy of openness and vulnerability because it was never shared with you. 

I think it starts with yourself. If you can't love yourself, you can't love others. The deeper the love you have inside yourself, the more you can share with others. 



Change is welcomed and expected as time marches on. I wish to build more energy, strength and resolve. This means training my body. Work takes a lot out of me currently. I'm usually sore afterward, so getting consistent with a stretching regimen will make a big impact on my quality of life.

I also wish to hike with her, or at least travel more at her hip. It's admittedly difficult for me to leave home. We both understand that. I'm endlessly entertained at home. She is not. I don't feel the desire for much socialization on my time off. Her job is solitary and by default she enjoys more socializing than I. There will always be an imbalance in those ways, and that's not a fault of anyone. I know she loves spending time outside with me, and I get a lot out of it too, so I want to spend more time like that. We'll be dead soon, even if we're lucky enough to live to 80, that's still soon in my book. I want to spend that time in nature, alongside other biological expressions of the universe. There's only so much man made stuff a human should be able to tolerate before they need to inhale some air mixed with other species.
