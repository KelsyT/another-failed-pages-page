I believe that humans are presently negatively affecting the health of the Earth, it's climate, and above all, the species who inhabit it. If you agree and feel conviction towards this belief, a (false) dichotomy may appear: To either stop caring about the world, and therefore lay waste in ignorant bliss (negative action), or to change your actions to make positive action upon the Earth. 

Those two points could be ends of a spectrum, and from the perspective of someone who wants the Earth to be healthier, I could denote a hyperbolic "Good" vs "Evil" comparison for each kind of action.

 | Evil | <-------------->| Good |
 | :--- | --------------|---: |
 | Negative action |<-------------->| Positive action|

Kind of upsetting if you're in the "Evil" camp huh? It sort of makes you feel like it's not even worth trying to change since you've probably been evil your whole damned life. I use good and evil more because it's easy and less because it's objectively right. I find it's easy to create these objectifications in my mind, even if it's hiding underneath the surface. I'll come back to this.

This presupposes that a person actually believes they can *do* Positive action in the first place. For if they are convinced there is nothing they can do and therefore capitulate, another point appears on our spectrum:

 | Evil | <-------------->| Good |<-------------->| Evil |
 | :--- | --------------|---| --------------|---|
 | Negative action |<-------------->| Positive action |<-------------->|Inaction |

Well I just opened a can of worms. I fall into all three camps. Does that make me more evil than good? If humans are the only threat to Earths health, then should I pull a Twelve Monkeys and try to commit mass killings so that morally "Good"? Or should I do the other thing. Suicide.

Well, I think this has gotten out of hand, as a cop out of the moral quandary I've just begun I want to direct your attention to a reason I made the dichotomy in the first place. 

A false dichotomy of "right and wrong", or "Good and Evil" is easy. It seems to be the way people get divided and it's stupid. I suppose there's often only three choices in the real world, action one way, action another way, or inaction, but there should be more options. People have great capacity and it's a shame to see that be seemingly reduced so often. 

When I think in spectrums, I don't visualize them like above, in 2 dimensions. I think more like a 3 dimensional vector, or a line originating from the center of a globe, pointing outward to some place place on the surface. The place doesn't matter, it's the idea of a multi coordinate spectrum. And this is why it's so hard to nail any of my opinions down. I genuinely *enjoy* seeing from other perspectives. 

If I don't agree, then there's contention, questions, listening, problem solving, and sometimes, connection. I crave that connection, merging of two or more minds together, finally meeting at an understanding between each other. Maybe even improving the idea in the process. 

Getting back to where I stand in regards to my personal experience on this planet. I cope with living on it despite my belief that the world may be better with less people, and since I am one, perhaps ending my own life, I have the following to say:

I believe that humans are amazing, as in, *they amaze me*, and that my own life is worth savoring just for the sheer ability to experience what I call individual consciousness. I just mean regular senses, like taste and touch, but also the super power that is putting thoughts and feelings together into an identity that I call "Kelsy". 

Yes, Alan Watts reminds me that I describing the "Ego", but wow do I enjoy being able to have the life and ego I do have. My life hasn't been without trauma, but I can safely say I do not contemplate suicide or wish for my experience here on earth to end. Simply put, I feel blessed to be here, appreciating what I can at the capacity I am able. Life is overwhelming, it's scary, but thankfully it's beautiful and awe inspiring.
