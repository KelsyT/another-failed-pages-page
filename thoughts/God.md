This resulted in me compulsively binging YouTube. Has anyone escaped it's pull? Anyway, I found myself wandering an ideological path of discovery thanks to my best friend James Hubbard. He watched The Amazing Atheist, and to a pair of edge-lord teenage boys he certainly was. I attempted to read both of the great atheist books, Hitchens' *God is not great* and Dawkins' *The God Delusion*. I didn't get far into either. I was much more fascinated with hearing the debate, watching the human emotion roaring and ringing in the ears. I watched countless atheists debate through (televised) recorded history and always found the atheists leagues above whichever god fearing soul they contended with.

At this time in my life, I was trying to rationalize existence itself. I was trying to find meaning when I felt none could be found. I still consider this sentiment: 

 "I believe my life is over when I die. Therefore, my existence is imbued with meaning because there *is* an end."

See, I already see holes in this, even though I will find it important to my life. If anything else, it's a reason to feel and express gratitude. Any moment may be your last. I don't think that imbues a life with meaning by itself, but if you're mindful of this and try to appreciate your own mortality in a positive light, it can turn something sad into the appreciation of what one has. And therefore feel like what ever it is a person is doing matters that much more.

I saw this attitude in the eyes of my sister just last week. She was laying on her couch with her three boys, two her own children, one her husband. They were in a cuddle pile, and she was looking at the eyes of her boys, gently caressing the hair on their head as they watched a movie called Onward. She is suffering from multiple forms of cancer, most recently a tumor in her brain which has wreaked hell on her. She's tough as nails. That look she had was one of pure appreciation like I've never seen. An attitude or outlook on life comparable to the one my sister had in that moment is one I try to have myself, to the capacity I can. It requires mindfulness, and appreciation.
