I was mostly atheist, apart from adoration of some video game worlds and a few crushes I formed growing up. My opinion of my dad was sky-high through my adolescence, but that faded and reversed as I grew up. His ability to cook, be handy, and work his full-time job meant that I was never hungry, without shelter or truly wanting. 

I see now there are so many experiences I couldn't've even *imagined* wishing for being the thoroughly house broken, video game addicted shut in for most of my years. I was and still am. What I wanted was the latest video games and consoles. As long as we visited Blockbuster I could rent another game. This cycle continued with novel, never ending glory as hours stretched to years immersed in these RenderWare worlds.

I want to say now that the things I call video games, the very things will continue to adore and respect are in fact sophisticated toys, as defined by Wikipedia: "A toy or plaything is an object that is used primarily for providing entertainment." In fact, I think "plaything" may be an even better word as some games certainly feel more like an instrument you "play" than a rigid, unchanging experience like a movie or song. Still though, kids and adults alike have wanted new, novel toys since toys have existed, and I see that more clearly than ever in my own life and relationship with video games.

My adoration of these came in endless internet fandom of all things geeky, one artifact of which was my subscription of Game Informer magazine. It was a distinctly tangible, offline, and light requiring work of beauty I looked forward to reading every issue. Multi-page previews of games mid-development featuring massive screenshots and concept art captured my imagination and sent me on countless hype trains. The journalists would, of course, set high expectations. Upon release, the reviews were often high if the game was ambitious, favoring open world exploration games like Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption. They're great, and everyone, including myself were enamored at the time with these sprawling worlds. In hindsight, I feel like there was always so much talk of video games as art (an argument I was happy to champion any time I could), and so much comparison with how games compared to movies as storytelling mediums. 

Now I find smaller games with a tight scope are the ones I appreciate most. Still ambitious, but often more focused on a novel experience instead of a "bigger" one. Stories that only games can tell. Portal, Braid and Limbo come to mind. And then there's Minecraft...

To dive deeper still into my subjective grasp of video games, 

We had satellite internet that was unlimited from 11pm to 4 am. This did not have a positive effect on my circadian rhythm throughout high school. And even when it was unlimited, I couldn't play the ridiculously addicting multiplayer games. I was stuck with single player games which were limited to what the developers could provide. Once I played a game for long enough, it would grow tiresome and lonely, no matter how great.
