A massive stone square lay between four equally massive buildings. Upon the discovery of the square, tribes of bipedal creatures settled across it's surface. The tribal creatures all diverged from a single ancestor, but were sufficiently isolated outside the square. This led to each of the tribes growing adaptations which set themselves apart. The least similar creatures still shared 99.7% of each other fundamentally. But that 0.3% caused seemingly endless strife. 

Many generations later they rose above the clouds atop a labyrinthine metropolis. And only atop their buildings could the creatures begin to see over the massive buildings. The city was built from forests, fields, rivers with endless varieties of flora and fauna. resources found in the surrounding buildings. 

These structures had perforations throughout all sides, ceiling and floor for ventilation.
