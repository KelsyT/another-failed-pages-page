To be one instead of I, we instead of my. Something that is truly alien to the assumptions of my way of life. I fetishize things that are different. Considering the ramifications an "ego" has on a person, an entity, a culture, a world of organisms appeals to me, captures my imagination. To wonder about how an alien species, or group of species, or a whole world could exist within that contrary framework of "We" instead of "I".

Constructing homes subtractively instead of additionally to ones environment crosses my mind. To tunnel into a mountain instead of building homes outside, adding a footprint to the world one inhabits. 

How does language work in a culture of "We?". Is that an egalitarian one? Apparently that word means "equality" more than "us all". How does hierarchy or inequality work in a "we?". Technology seems to be a driving force of Homo Sapien "Wise Man" evolution, that is, once the "intelligence threshold" through millions of years of Darwinian evolution of the various homo species existence has been met. 

A myth is an image in terms of which we try to make sense of the world. - Alan Watts

So what are the Myths of a people with Ego? Like Humans, they share their lives with their environment. No species that I am aware of can live in a true vacuum - they rely on an endless growing assortment of nature to survive. So the aliens of "we" could very well follow a similar path Humans do in evolution past the intelligence threshold. They may have an entirely different kind of intelligence though. 

The ego is nothing other than the focus of conscious attention. - Alan Watts

It seems the memetic nature of passing down ideas form one generation to the next using language and other symbols has allowed us to build an understanding of the world around us. I think this could still be done without the development of an ego, or at least a culture like the USA which exploits it so much. 

How does a society progress without separating itself from the symbiosis of it's environment? This is making me think of the piggies form Speak for the Dead. I barely remember what they are like or what they do, I just remember them turning into a tree at some stage of their life, a metamorphosis.

Dark chitinous tubes as thick as the thickest tree trunks carry resources from point A to B to C back to A then to D ad infinitum. Meandering through hills, valleys, forests and mountains, under ground and above it, stretching across the landscape with tendrils as fine as mycelium intersecting and flowing away from each tube. A network of messy veins randomly strewn across the whole planets surface. 

The myths underlying our culture and underlying our common sense have not taught us to feel identical with the universe, but only parts of it, only in it, only confronting it - aliens. - Alan Watts
