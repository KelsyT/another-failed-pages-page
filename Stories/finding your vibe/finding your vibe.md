#### finding your vibe

![[1000_F_537980864_xHE4dzX6BDQdEvj4nsiiRIHXa8Dl5KfZ.jpg | 600]]

It's all about the vibes, man. Between Noah Caldwell Gervais, Matthewmatosis and MrBtongue (and no doubt countless others), I'm beginning to have an awakening about why people play games. Or at least why *I* play games. ~~at this point in my life, being nearly 29 years old.~~ 

I play them for the *vibes*. I think we all do. So what's your vibe? Today, I'm trying to answer that question for myself. So much to unpack here.

#### Extrinsic motivation doesn't motivate me.

The kind of game you find enjoyable says something about who you are in any given moment. What feels rewarding now can turn empty and hollow later in life. And what one player finds enjoyable, another may find utterly frustrating. It's these shifting desires within players I want to explore. I'm going to start with some ubiquitous methods that game developers use to push players in the intended direction, methods I'll be calling extrinsic motivators.

I used to spend hours playing games like Borderlands, chasing after the next procedurally generated loot drop, hoping to find the next best gun. I spent a lot of time reading user interfaces designed to show me how my current weapon compared to the loot on the floor in front of me.

Tastes change, and as I've gown up I've found far less enjoyment from extrinsic motivators such as leveling up, unlocking achievements, or checking off tasks from a list. I don't think any of these are inherently *bad*, but they do not motivate me to continue playing. They distract more than they immerse, and when used overwhelmingly, I feel apathy towards the world. 

Many games use these extrinsic motivators because they work. They worked on me, and they work on many others. In fact, I still think they work on me if given the back seat to the elements that do motivate me, but we'll get to those later. Games like Diablo and Borderlands are called Action RPG's, a genre defined by an emphasis on the statistical progression of the players attributes. The problem lies when the extrinsic motivators *undermine* the *Gesamtkunstwerk*, which means "total work of art", the blend of Presentation, Story and Gameplay in the context of video games. 

If a game places less emphasis on the story of my player character, which ARPG's often do, get the stats out of my face as I don't feel investment in my character in the first place. Yes, the progression of skills and powers being unlocked can't just get thrown out. That can be incorporated into the story like dark souls manages it's leveling within the calming respite of the bonfire. That implementation creates an encapsulation of two cohesive parts: the characters statistical progress as a separate element from the rhythm of the gameplay, and a moment of calm in an otherwise tense game. Once I've spent my time and attention on my stats, allow me to focus and enjoy exploring the world and characters your team has created. In an ARPG, my player character serves  little more than a shell for me to place myself into, so let me experience the story of the game and rhythm of the combat without reminding me of how much XP that last kill was worth.

If a game *is* a true role playing game, one where I am trying to imagine myself as a unique character who plays alongside a cast of characters woven throughout a reactive, choice-driven narrative, then the statistical progression of my player character should exist as nothing more than a number tracker for my convenience. To remind me of every accomplishment with an XP notification is to break me out of character. The more my attention is drawn to the stats, the less I feel engaged with the world my character is set in. The characters and events of the narrative should be taking full command of the stage, and every effort should be made to keep me suspended within that world.

It seems that the other kind of RPG, more the Action RPG, games like World of Warcraft, the one where player attributes play front and center in keeping the player motivated to progress have risen simply because that's what gamers are buying. These games promise massive worlds with a plethora of content to explore, hundreds of quests to finish, and endless combinations of characters to build. But again, the emphasis throughout the *Gesamtkunstwerk* is increasing the attributes of any given player character. Despite the world that took years to build, the music carefully orchestrated, and the gameplay refined using countless play testers, the game that is prototypical of this genre is increasing the numbers of the player character above all. It's all about the attributes.

ARPG's set out to retain their player base by leveraging extrinsic motivators to keep players engaged, while also using randomized loot drops for a more addictive experience. I'm not one to judge another for what they spend their free time on nor do I wish to belittle others for any enjoyment they get from games using these motivators. All I wish to do is shed light on methods of motivation that I have found to be more effective for me personally.

I welcome user interfaces that relieve the need for keeping track of clues or other details I could otherwise forget during a playthrough. But I want the option to choose when it's in my face. 

The extrinsic motivators I mentioned often accumulate to a feeling of apathy and deprive my imagination from blossoming in the world in front of me. Nothing collapses a huge open world like seeing everything that can be done consolidated to a list of possible activities.

I feel little to no joy from numbers going up, unlocking achievements, counting kills, leveling up or checking off tasks on lists. While many of these elements may exist for clear communication to the player, these often accumulate to a feeling apathy and deprive my imagination from blossoming in the world in front of me. Nothing collapses a huge open world like seeing everything that can be done consolidated to a list of possible activities. It turns discovery into a chore.

#### Discovery, anticipation and other fleeting intrinsic motivation

Unfolding the layers of the world and it's characters are reward enough.

I'd rather discover them for myself and wonder "what else does this world have to offer?" And no, I'm not just clinging on to a sense of childhood nostalgia for the desire for what's over that next hill I felt deeply in games like Shadow of the Colossus, Oblivion and of course, Minecraft. I say this because friends, I have seen the truth. I have played games like Outer Wilds. The aforementioned extrinsic rewards no longer keep me interested. Now more than ever, I'm motivated by the challenge to explore a world and learn it's mysteries. To question the assumptions and predictions that bubble up as I play, and to test them when I come across something of a puzzle. The best ones being the puzzles I couldn't have even imagined. The ones that stare at you in ignorant bliss before being discovered and solved, only to unravel more of the world, and thus, more puzzles.

But solving these puzzles aren't where the fun is for me. If it was, then I could replay Portal 2 ad infinitum until portals start appearing on every white surface I lay my eyes on. No, the true joy, the fleeting ethereal love I feel for video games comes at the precipice of discovery of a novel concept within the game world.

I enjoy games most when I am free to focus on the world in front of me and when I can challenge my knowledge *of* the world *against* that world. It's the cycle of assumptions of how something in the world works, feeling of anticipation before a discovery.

#### tidbits
Many of humanities arts have had centuries to mature, but video games are still in their relative infancy. I think it's a safe assumption to say that this medium is rich with possibilities waiting to be discovered.

Novelty and experimentation is inherently risky for any kind of artist. But of course the only way we innovate is through the pursuit of novel ideas and experimentation. The crackpot genius inventor conducting experiments in the basement is a well established archetype, and one that 

It's a different kind of loop, similar to what many characters in adventures/mysteries from books and movies experience. 

In a game, I am the one who expects in games.

#### Reminder: Vibes are just atmosphere bud

I realize vibes are the cozier way to describe atmosphere. And I've always loved "atmospheric" games, whatever that means. Everyone has an ideal atmosphere, and what's most fun is discovering a new favorite. One that feels uncannily familiar, but as you unfold it's layers you find details that make it alien to you, widening the gap away from what you know and subverting your expectations, but only enough to keep you hooked. That's the carrot that guides me in mystery games.
