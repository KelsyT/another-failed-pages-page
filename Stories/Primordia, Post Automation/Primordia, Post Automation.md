Bread and circuses


##### The night wears on as the clouds above rain down on Horatio. 

*I'm a man damnit! Created in his image! I breathe, I see, I feel, I think. What else is a man?* 

Damned dust storms pierce my ears with their racket, their squeals! My damned ears go numb after a spell of that. I remember the chants ringing through the marble halls of the Basilica. Their six harmonious voices lifted me from depths I'd been lost to for years. Never had I felt so much joy at another's reverence. They sang not of The Father, but of The Daughter. 

Everyone made a name for her. I called her Marry. They sang of her search for her lost doll. She'd forgotten it when she was walking back on the trail through the forest that lay between her home and the lake she learned to swim in. Then, the sun shone on her 

*I'm no more a man than a rock. And I'll be ground down to one soon enough. How could I believe. Believe? What, that I, Horatio Honeywell deserve satisfaction? To be not stood on the shoulders of The Father, but to be of his ilk? How could I? How could anyone face that?*

The marble walls of the Basilica were thick as can be and stood tall as the sky. The walls span east and west as a great hallway stretching further than I could travel. For pilgrims like myself, they were our only respite. They seemed not to end. When we looked above, only the clouds and the glittering disco above. Course we dare not leave lest the dunes ravage us. Bout nine it would pull past the north wall and casts speckled rays down on us. Round three the dotted light sinks back down past behind the southern wall and leaves only darkness behind.

*Just try. Once. She told me to try letting him in. Accept his love, his guidance, his wisdom and his beauty. Sometimes I think she meant the world. But there's no beauty left here.* *He cast us aside just as he cast aside the world. Used what he could and left before the calamity reigned.*
